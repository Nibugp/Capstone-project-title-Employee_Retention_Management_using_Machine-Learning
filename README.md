## Machine-learning-capstone-project-title-Employee_Retention_Management

In this machine learning capstone project, I explored and evaluated multiple algorithms to identify the most reliable model, synthesizing key concepts in machine learning, data preparation, and predictive modeling to develop a robust and actionable solution.

**üìÅ Dataset Overview**
/n The dataset used contains 1,680 employee records from a global ERD organization, with features spanning demographics, compensation, performance, tenure, and promotion history. Given an attrition rate of 27%, class imbalance was a key challenge.

**‚öôÔ∏è Data Preparation & Processing**
/n The data underwent the following processing steps:
- Missing value imputation for performance and promotion columns.
- Feature engineering, including tenure in months, time since last promotion, and promotion frequency.
- Categorical encoding (Label, One-Hot, and Ordinal).
- Standardization of numerical features.
- Class imbalance handling using SMOTE to improve model sensitivity toward minority class (attrition cases).
